## Project Overview
This file documents the current state, structure, and recent changes of the Hospital-frontend project. It will be updated with every significant change, including bug fixes, feature additions, and refactors.

## Current State (as of August 16, 2025)

### 1. App Structure
- **App.js**: Renders only the `Navbar` and `HomePage` components. No routing or authentication context is present.
- **index.js**: Standard React entry point, renders `<App />` inside `<React.StrictMode>`.
- **Navbar & HomePage**: Fully implemented and styled, provide the main UI and navigation.
- **PranaAICharacter, CompactMeditationFigure, InteractiveMeditationFigure**: Present and functional, used for UI/UX features.

### 2. Authentication & Routing
- All authentication and protected route logic is currently **absent**.
- The following files exist but are **empty**:
  - `AuthContext.js`
  - `LoginForm.jsx`, `LoginPage.jsx`, `RegisterForm.jsx`, `RegisterPage.jsx`, `ProtectedRoute.jsx`, `Profile.jsx`, `ProfilePage.jsx`, `AuthPage.jsx`, `api.js`

### 3. Other Notes
- No API integration or backend communication is present in the frontend.
- No user state, login, or registration flows are active.
- No protected routes or profile features are active.

## August 16, 2025 — Session-Based Authentication Plan Added

### Goal
Implement session-based authentication (JWT, 1-hour expiry) for both backend (Django) and frontend (React):
- Public landing page for all visitors.
- CTA buttons check session: if logged in, go to CTA; if not, redirect to Sign In/Sign Up.
- Session tokens expire after 1 hour.

### Backend Plan
- Use Django REST Framework + SimpleJWT for JWT auth.
- Endpoints:
  - POST /api/auth/register
  - POST /api/auth/login
  - POST /api/auth/logout
  - GET /api/auth/session
- Middleware checks for valid/expired tokens.
- Tokens expire in 1 hour; optional refresh for "Remember Me".

### Frontend Plan
- Landing page is public.
- CTA buttons call checkSession() (GET /api/auth/session).
- If session valid, route to CTA page; if not, route to Sign In/Sign Up.
- Use httpOnly cookie for token storage.
- Auto-logout and friendly message on expiry.
- Optional: "Remember Me", loading spinner, silent refresh.

### Next Steps
- Start backend implementation (SimpleJWT setup, endpoints, middleware).
- Start frontend implementation (session check utility, ProtectedRoute, login/logout UI).

## August 16, 2025 — Backend Auth Endpoints Implemented

- JWT-based authentication is set up using SimpleJWT.
- Endpoints available:
  - POST /api/accounts/register/ — User registration
  - POST /api/accounts/login/ — Login, returns JWT
  - POST /api/accounts/logout/ — Logout (blacklists refresh token)
  - GET /api/accounts/session/ — Session validation (returns 200 if valid, 401 if not)
- User model supports username, email, phone, is_doctor, is_admin.
- All endpoints are documented and ready for frontend integration.
